dataValidate
============

If you have two or more datasets and they don't share a key that can be
used to match each entity then you have a problem. Not like a personal
problem just a data problem. dataValidate makes some efforts to solve
that problem.

The focus is CSV and Yelp API data. This will be pretty poorly documented
for some time so apologies in advance.
